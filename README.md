The full analysis including the three steps are in the Jupyter Notebook document: **NYC Thanksgiving taxi trips 2018 analysis.ipynb**

In this project we will be analyzing a dataset containing information regarding NY taxi trips on Thanksgiving 2018.

The scope of the project includes several steps:
1. **Explore and clean the data:** As in any other project, there is a fundamental first phase that needs to be implemented in order to validate the completeness and the correctness of data. First, the nature of the data will be explored, to know the nº of samples, nº of variables and how data is distributed. Besides, data will be cleaned to ease more advanced analytics that will follow in the next stages.

2. **Data summary and relevant trends:** The NY city council is very interested on understanding taxi trips on thanksgiving. We will attempt to discover relevant insights that may be very impactful for public politics. Therefore, we will look for trends on data and present them on such a way that workers at the NY city council can easily interpret them. This stage will involve exploring relations among variables that may lead to insightful findings. On top of that, visualizations will be very useful to understand relations and to bring to light hidden patterns on data.

3. **Model building:** Finally, the NY city council is interested on the typical tip clients give to taxi drivers and what factors influence the tip the most. In order to do so, we will be focusing our analysis on the tips building several machine learning models that may help us and the city council to understand how tips behave.
